  <h6>WHEN WAS STARBUCKS FOUNDED? </h6>
  <p>When the first Starbucks opened in 1971, our company was a single store in Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. From just a narrow storefront, Starbucks offered some of the world’s finest fresh-roasted whole bean coffees. The name, inspired by Moby Dick, evoked the romance of the high seas and the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders. </p>
<p>In 1981, Howard Schultz (Starbucks former chairman, president and chief executive officer) first walked into a Starbucks store. From his first cup of Sumatra, Howard was drawn into Starbucks and joined a year later.</p>
<p>In 1983, Howard traveled to Italy and became captivated with Italian coffee bars and the romance of the coffee experience. He had a vision to bring the Italian café tradition back to the United States. He wanted to create a place for conversation and a sense of community—a third place between work and home. He left the company for a short period of time to start his own Il Giornale cafés and returned in August 1987 to purchase Starbucks with the help of local investors.</p>

    <h4>THE STARBUCKS MISSION </h4>
    <p>From the beginning, Starbucks set out to be a different kind of company. One that not only celebrated coffee and rich tradition, but that also brought a feeling of connection. Our mission is to inspire and nurture the human spirit—one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time. </p>

    <h6>MORE THAN COFFEE  </h6>
    <p>To say Starbucks purchases and roasts high-quality whole bean coffee is very true. That’s the essence of what we do—but it hardly tells the whole story.  </p>
 <p>Starbucks cafés  have become a beacon for coffee lovers everywhere. Why do they insist on going to a Starbucks  café? Because they know they can count on genuine service, an inviting atmosphere,  and a superb cup of expertly roasted and richly brewed coffee every time.</p>
